    <h1>Morgan Makes</h1>
    <p>My name is Morgan, and I make things. A lot of things. Some of my biggest skills are webdev, sewing, and singing,
      but I also enjoy writing, acting, knitting, drawing/painting, and way too many things to list. This page is a
      place to find links for everything that I do, and will only be added to over time. I hope to eventually add a
      webdev and gamedev portfolio, and perhaps an art portfolio.</p>
    <p>I have a learning disability that makes me a bit slow at processing outside information (including dyslexia,
      hence the font on this page), but growing up with this has led to developing highly efficient processing on the
      inside, as a way of keeping up. I'm very good at math and problem solving. This is probably why I love programming
      so much--most of the processing can happen inside of my head.</p>
    <h2 id="dev">Webdev and Gamedev</h2>
    <div>
      <p>I'm especially proficient in JavaScript (including node.js and React), but I have experience in Java and C#
        (and have played around with Python, Julia, PHP, SQL and C++) and can learn very quickly. The languages that I
        didn't learn a lot of weren't because they were too hard, only because I didn't have any projects I wanted to do
        with them. If given a project and a language I don't know that I have to do it with, I'll simply learn that
        language.</p>
      <p>In fact, since making this website I've gotten pretty okay at development in Rust, and plan to use it for more
        projects in the future. I've even made a neural network in Rust that I plan to adapt for various purposes.</p>
      <p>You can support my web and game development on my <a href="https://patreon.com/mergerg">dev Patreon</a>, but I
        don't guarantee I'll post there often. A good place to find things I've finished is <a
          href="https://mergerg.itch.io">itch.io</a>, and when I'm working on something I often post about it on <a
          href="https://tech.lgbt/@mergerg" rel="me">Mastodon</a>. My primary issue with webdev and gamedev is
        motivation: if I'm not getting paid to finish a project and I don't have a bunch of other people excited about
        it, I'm likely to get excited about something else before finishing it.</p>
      <p>A note on this page: I made this website very minimalist because I prefer it that way, and it often makes the
        website more accessible. I'm not limited to simple colors and singular fonts. If you'll look at the <a
          href="style.css">CSS</a> for this page, you'll note that I actually did put work into it, because even though
        I want it to look minimalist, I wanted to perfect it for every screen. I can adjust the way I design websites
        for different purposes. This website serves my purpose.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="art">Visual Art</h2>
    <p>I've been traditionally drawing and painting since I was little. Bob Ross was my major inspiration that got me
      into painting, and I used the cheapest acrylics we could find because I was poor. I still occasionally do acrylic painting, but I'm more
      likely to do digital art since I got a computer with which I can draw directly on the screen. I occasionally post
      my art on <a href="https://mastodon.art/@raphaelmorgan/media">Mastodon</a>, but since I work on it so little, I
      tend to save it for my <a href="https://patreon.com/raphaelmorgan">general Patreon</a> and <a href="https://ko-fi.com/raphaelmorgan">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="sewing">Sewing</h2>
    <p>I've been sewing for about 4 years on and off, but most of what I've learned has been in the last 6 months or so.
      So far swimsuits are my favorite thing to sew. My experience has been limited by access to materials, but most of
      what I've sewn so far I've also posted about on <a href="https://mastodon.art/@raphaelmorgan"
        rel="me">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://patreon.com/raphaelmorgan">Patreon</a>. I've sewn several garments for
      myself, a skirt for a friend, and a couple of garments for my nephew. I also sewed both my "suit" and my spouse's
      dress for our wedding. I'm an avid fan of <a href="https://freesewing.org">FreeSewing</a>, and you can find me on
      their <a href="https://freesewing.social/@raphaelmorgan" rel="me">Mastodon instance</a> as well.</p>
    <h2 id="knitting">Knitting and crochet</h2>
    <p>I've always been pretty good at knitting freestyle and coming up with patterns etc, but I'm limited in how much
      knitting I can do because of my arthritis. It is something I'd like to get back to, though. Crocheting is
      something that I know how to do, and I very much enjoy the boundless creativity it offers, but it hurts my wrists
      too much for me to do it with any degree of regularity.</p>
    <p>I did at one point commit to putting knitting patterns on my Patreon, but it proved to be too much for me to do
      monthly. At some point I may put together a zine of simple knitting patterns.</p>
    <h2 id="music">Music</h2>
    <p>I've been writing songs for as long as I can remember, and I've been publishing them on YouTube since I was 17
      (so about 5 years). I have some music released on all major platforms under the name of "Raphael Sizemore", but
      the production quality is not good. I hope to do a better job soon producing some of my other songs. Lately, I've gotten into writing scores on MuseScore. I don't release them on
      MuseScore.com, but I've posted some on <a href="https://patreon.com/raphaelmorgan">Patreon</a> and some will be in
      musicals I hope to eventually publish.</p>
