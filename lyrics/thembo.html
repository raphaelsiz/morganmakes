  <h1>Thembo</h1>
  <h4>Raphael Sizemore</h4>
  <p>I usually write about situations
  <br>How much someone hurt me, or memories I'm not proud of
  <br>And I've written my share of love songs--celebrations
  <br>But always about the details, never the person I love
  <br>But something special happens when I think about you
  <br>And every time I see your pretty face
  <br>The music comes from out of nowhere, all around you
  <br>Pulls my tongue out for a serenade
  </p>
  <p>I love the way you're such an asshole, but so kind
  <br>--good thing you're mine
  <br>I love the way you bullshit but you're self aware
  <br>I love the way you pull bits of wisdom out of thin air
  <br>Baby, I just can't believe my luck
  <br>Is this what it's like to be in love?
  </p>
